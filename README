The Hangman AI project contains the following files:


    	    - hang.py: Code written in python to implement hangman AI.
	    - words.txt: A library of commonly used words used by hang.py to
	      		 determine what characters to choose during the game.
	    - README: A project description.



Build and Run details:

My hangman AI is written in python, and run using Python 3.6.5. The code relies
on the requests library to send to and receive from the server http requests.
The string, time, and random libraries are also required for this AI to run.
The code is executed using the python3 command:

$ python3 hang.py

I have not given write permissions to hang.py, so simply trying to run it on
the command line with ./hang.py will not work.
