The Hangman AI project contains the following files:


    	    - hang.py: Code written in python to implement hangman AI.
	    - words.txt: A library of commonly used words used by hang.py to
	      		 determine what characters to choose during the game.
	    - README: A project description.



Build and Run details:

My hangman AI is written in python, and run using Python 3.6.5. The code relies
on the requests library to send to and receive from the server http requests.
The string, time, and random libraries are also required for this AI to run.
The code is executed using the python3 command if run on the linux departmental
servers:

$ python3 hang.py

You may also run this program using the Windows 10 command line, assuming you
downloaded python 3.6.5. To run with the Windows 10 command line, you must use
the py command.

$ py hang.py

In either case, you must enter the directory where hang.py is located, and make
sure than the file words.txt is in the same directory as hang.py, otherwise the
program will not run properly. When you wish to exit, use the interrupt command
(^C).

I have not given executable permissions to hang.py, so simply trying to run it
on the command line with ./hang.py will not work. Futhermore the code relies on
properties of python version 3 specifically. Using an earlier version of python
will not work.
